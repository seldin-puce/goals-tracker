# Goals Tracker

Welcome to the readme file for my third project in the series, the Goals Tracker. This project focuses on helping users set and track their goals effectively. As I continue my journey to master React, I developed this project to further enhance my skills and demonstrate my progress.

## Introduction

The Goals Tracker is a web application that enables users to create and manage their goals. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding new goals, tracking progress, and deleting goals as necessary.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used to write the application logic.
- **HTML**: The markup language for creating the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: The styling language for enhancing the visual appearance of the application.

## Project Setup

To run the Expense Tracker project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```console
git clone git@github.com:seldin-puce/goals-tracker.git
```    

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```console
cd goals-tracker
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```console
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```console
npm start
```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the Expense Tracker.

## Features

The Expense Tracker project includes the following features:

- **Add Expense**: Users can add a new expense by providing details such as description, amount, and date.
- **Edit Expense**: Users can edit the details of an existing expense, including its description, amount, and date.
- **Delete Expense**: Users can delete an expense from the list.
- **Expense List**: The application displays a list of all the expenses, showing their description, amount, and date.

## Conclusion

Creating the Expense Tracker has been an exciting experience for me as I start learning React. It has helped me understand the core concepts of React, such as component-based architecture, state management, and handling user interactions.

I plan to continue expanding my knowledge of React by working on more challenging projects in the future. I believe this Expense Tracker project is just the beginning of my journey towards becoming a proficient React developer.
